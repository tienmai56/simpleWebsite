                    <p>Amid the battle of internship hunting, I was among the most stressed out. By the end of my
                        third-year at Babson College in Boston, MA. I was certain that I wanted to get involved in the
                        intersection between business and tech, and decided to do concentrations on Business Analytics &
                        Information Technology. I believe that business is a way to make change and solve problems in
                        the
                        community, but tech is the tool to make all that happen.</p>

                    <p>Much as Babson has provided me with excellent resources, I personally feel that there’s a serious
                        lack of technology and computer science classes at my business school. I came directly to higher
                        education from Vietnam and unfortunately, coding is not offered as part of the official academic
                        program in public schools there. I took/enrolled in my first coding class in my sophomore year
                        at
                        Wellesley College, which offers some cross-registration courses with Babson. Before then, I
                        thought
                        CSS is a name of an online video game.</p>

                    <p>By the end of my third year, with not much tech background but a determination to pursue my tech
                        career, apparently I felt like a clueless goldfish, swimming and swirling inside my own glass
                        tank
                        that I did not know how to break out of.</p>
                    <p>I was, however, rather fortunate</p>
                    <p>By May, I’d spent the last 2 months scattering out my resume to over lord-know-how-many companies
                        in
                        the US Right when I was about to return to Southeast Asia, someone from Fidelity Investment
                        called
                        me, and asked if I would like to interview for their technology internship position. I ended up
                        going through their 2-round interview, and after 10 weeks , I can’t say how much I’m grateful
                        for
                        this amazing opportunity. As a goldfish in a tiny aquarium, someone
                        threw in a hook and set me free to swim through the ocean tides.</p>

                    <p>I was, admittedly, insanely nervous and intimidated, being the only intern in the NLP (Natural
                        Language Processing) chapter not from a tech school or major. This organization’s space is alive
                        and
                        pulsating with constant energy.. The people are brilliant and they process information and codes
                        in
                        lighting speed. I was working in a team of three and especially involved with the Virtual
                        Assistant
                        landscape.</p>
                    <p>Very recently, I have completed my internship. I’d like to share some of its most valuable
                        takeaways
                        for me, that I think could be valuable and applicable to anyone’s future internship endeavor.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Self-learning</h2>
                    <p>I can’t stress how important self-learning is. School will never teach you enough. At my third
                        year,
                        I decided it’s time to pick up Python again. I was interested in data analytics so I went on
                        Coursera to find data course. I enrolled in two courses, one was a basic Python course The other
                        was
                        on Pandas & Numpy, the very two basic and essential Python libraries for data science.. My
                        schedule
                        at Babson drove me insane, quite honestly. I was taking 18 credits and working part-time for a
                        start-up remotely,so the only time I had was a two hour break in between my morning and
                        afternoon
                        classes, and the weekend. On the weekend, I would cram as much as possible, trying to finish a
                        1-month course in 2 weeks (to save time and money, of course! Saving money is essential as a
                        business student..) I certainly was not an expert by the end of the course, but I did learn
                        enough to
                        use it at my internship. I used Pandas and Python for a project, which was building a
                        notification
                        system that alerts our business team when our chatbot needs retraining. Seeing my Pandas course
                        come in so handy
                        was so motivating/inspirational/exciting</p>

                    <h2>2. Always ask “Why”</h2>
                    <p>It sounds cliche and simple but people, at least me, never really think about it. When working in
                        a
                        technical team, aka not being on the front lines like business people, it’s too easy to fall
                        into
                        the trap of jumping into the details and think about HOW to make something work but forget to
                        think
                        about WHY we need to make this work. What is the purpose of what we are building? Why are we
                        doing
                        this work? Who is directly benefiting from it and what return are we bringing to the
                        stakeholders ?
                        My client wants to achieve X, but is he considering the current state of Y?</p>

                    <p>A problem statement can be written in a 3 sentences but when you start to put the question mark
                        Why
                        Why Why, you realize there are more than one layer in it. “Why” is easily neglected, but it’s
                        the
                        core of building a solid business mindset, as well as tracking down a technical problem.</p>

                    <h2>3. Always remember what gets you excited</h2>
                    <p>In my last day, one of my mentors asked me “with no consideration to factors like the number of
                        figures in your salary, location, etc, what kind of work would make you the most excited?”. When
                        I’m
                        21 and try to learn everything and maybe fail a couple of times, no one will give me a second
                        look
                        for it. But I imagine as I grow older, and still question myself every single day,whether ‘“I’m
                        satisfied working on this’, doesn’t seem as ideal. My mentor gave me motivation and a reminder
                        of
                        how important it is to be open-minded to being hungry for learning everything I can handle. But
                        at
                        the same time, Carefully observe how my interests form and evolve as I learn more of myself and
                        my
                        career.</p>

                    <h2>4. “There are three types of people others will remember: people who are smart, people who work
                        hard, and people who help them”.</h2>
                    <p>When you are an intern in a field that you’re trying to learn more about, accept whatever tasks
                        others don’t want . Jump in. Help with the seemingly mundane work that may bring a new
                        opportunity
                        you never knew because that little small thing can pop up in a conversation with someone who can
                        connect you to a new opportunity.</p>

                    <h2>5. You will never know enough…</h2>
                    <img src="assets/img/motivation.jpeg" width="650px">

                    <p>I was a novice to NLP. I took some quantitative and Machine Learning classes at college, but
                        still had
                        much to learn. It took me more than a week to get myself familiar with the different systems
                        that
                        various teams would use. My two teammates were so talented and they had a background related to
                        NLP,
                        in one way or another. Working with people with such a strong base of knowledge in this field, I
                        tried to research and asked many questions. I have never used the database system that the
                        company
                        uses either, but was able to pick it up from some introductory courses online, and just
                        exploring
                        through practical tasks. Organizations use diverse means to construct their organization, store
                        data, choose which tools to employ. </p>
                    <p>The most important things is that how willing you are to spend
                        some extra miles doing research and trying to pick up the new concept as fast as possible.</p>
