                    <p><i>“I don’t know why, when I connect this printer to my laptop, there’s no sign of success. No one
                    seems to have the same problem, though, since I haven’t heard of anyone complaining about it. This
                    means I’ll probably look dumb if I ask.”</i></p>

                    <p>I don’t know if this hypothetical scenario resonates with you, but I found that some people, myself
                    included, fall into this vicious loop sometimes. We seem to develop a self-critic mechanism whenever
                    we fail to perform a seemingly simple task. People rarely blame object design, because they think
                    such a simple task should not require further instruction, so the problem must, rather, lie on their
                    own capability.</p>


                    <p>Imagine how many new household appliances and devices come into use every day, while we only have a
                    split second to learn how to use some of them. The design of everyday things, in order to provide
                    the best user experience, should follow a set of criteria. This principle is very well-analyzed in
                    The Design of Everyday Things by Donald Norman. This book has me questioning every single object I
                    use now.</p>
                    <h2>1. Visibility</h2>
                    <p>Visibility in designing an everyday object is when users have a clear image of what functionality
                    possibly could be performed. Most of the time, users get confused when they find the result of their
                    execution is in conflict with their original intention due to a lack of cues. A successful design
                    provides sufficient cues that match the users’ expectation. Let’s look at the very simple example of
                    the door, pictured:</p>
                    <img src="assets/img/visibility.jpeg" style="width: 600px; border: gray;">

                   
                    <p>I chose a seat facing the entrance, after ordering myself a cup of ginger tea, eyes glued to the
                    door. To my surprise, 20 minutes have passed, and I’ve counted five people coming in and pushing the
                    door when it’s supposed to be pulled. The design of this door might cause confusion, because people
                    don’t know which side is to be pulled and which is to be pushed. A sign of “Push” and “Pull” was
                    written in Vietnamese, but most people still fail to open the door, because lots of them don’t speak
                    Vietnamese.</p>

                    <p>Instructions on how to perform certain executions should only be required when the object offers
                    more than a single functionality. In this case, a simple act, such as opening the door, should not
                    require users to spend extra time to read an instruction, not to even mention that the instruction
                    is not inclusively designed, because it’s only applicable to a certain group of users (people who
                    read Vietnamese, in this case). In Norman’s book, the author uses many examples of how to redesign
                    the door. I totally recommend you check it out for additional details.</p>
                    <h2>2. Providing feedback</h2>
                    <p>The first time I used the office printer, I was unable to figure out how to connect it to my laptop.
                    I was instructed to connect the cable into my computer, but nothing happened afterward. There was no
                    sign from the printer to signal whether I had succeeded.</p>

                    <p>Feedback is the act of communicating the result of one’s action. Most of the times users fail
                    miserably to work an object is due to a lack of feedback.</p>
                    <p>In order for a user to figure out quickly how an object works, the object design should provide
                    feedback that is immediate and informative. If I have to wait for more than two minutes for the
                    printer to show some signs of success or failure, I will definitely give up. A delay in giving
                    feedback, even if it’s only an extra second, will discourage users from using it. However, if the
                    feedback is immediate, without providing any further instruction in case the execution fails, then
                    it won’t benefit the user either. If users are unable to create their profile on your website, for
                    example, there should be a message explaining why.</p>
                    <p>An example of failing to provide feedback is from Bumble. When I want to delete my photo and upload
                    a new one by hitting that “+” icon, nothing happens. For the first two times, I was waiting for
                    around three seconds, and I thought it was a bug, so I just gave up. On my third attempt, I waited
                    for, like, five seconds before the new photo was displayed.</p>
                    <p>You can try to test it yourself, if you have Bumble on your phone. The profile editing section will
                    look something like this:</p>
                    <img src="assets/img/feedback.png" style="width: 600px; border: gray;">


                    <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">3. Natural mappings</h2>
                    <p>Natural mapping is the relationship between an object’s property and its layout, based on cultural
                    standards and physical analogies (e.g., the door should be opened from the right, red light means
                    stop, etc.). Successful object design allows users to perform an action that corresponds to the
                    user’s predefined concept.</p>
                    <p>An example of a stove’s layout, below, describes this concept very well:</p>
                    <img src="assets/img/mapping.png" style="width: 800px; height:400px; border: gray;">

                    <h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">4. Affordance</h2>
                    <p>This is actually pretty close to the concept of natural mapping. While natural mapping is more about
                    the correspondence between users’ predefined concept and an object’s layout, affordance determines
                    how an object can be used. For example: a door to push, a printer to print papers, a button to push,
                    a chair to sit on. Users should be able to know right away how to use an object just by looking at
                    it.</p>

                    <p>For example, when I look at the water handle, below, should I push the button or turn it around?
                    It’s not clear.</p>
                    <img src="assets/img/affordance.png" style="width: 650px; height: 400px; border: gray;">

                    <p>So that’s my recap of what I think stands out from the book and can be easily applied to not only
                    everyday things, but also software development. You might have a different takeaway, and if you are
                    interested in further details, definitely check out the book!</p>
